# Learning Lua [LÖVE](https://love2d.org)

A little project with my son, learning programming with Lua.

To run, [install LÖVE](https://rvagamejams.com/learn2love/pages/02-01-up-and-running.html) and run `love .` in this folder.

At the moment there's a JavaScript implementation, too, just because I wanted to make one. Open `main.html` in your preferred web browser. No promises the JavaScript version stays up to date, though. I think that's going to get harder once we're doing more than drawing polygons.
